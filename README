iCalFilter Tool

I am managing my appointments using Outlook on windows and iCal on OS X. 
Since I am not using any Exchange service right now I was happy to find out 
that Outlook offers a functionality to export a local calendar automatically 
to an iCalendar compatible ICS file. Great feature but it lacks some things I
desperately need.

Since I am managing my private and my business appointments in the same
calendar, differentiating just by categories, I had a hard time configuring
outlook to export 
	a) an ics file containing all business appointments and 
	b) an ics file containing all private appointments. It’s not possible
	   to make the story short.

So I fired up Visual Studio as usual and wrote my own filter tool. I shall call
it “iCalFilter”. It’s name is as simple as it’s functionality and code. I am
releasing it under BSD license including the sources so everyone can use and
modify it.

It’s a command line tool which should compile on Microsoft .NET and Mono. It
takes several command line parameters like:

   1. Input-File
   2. Output-File
   3. “include” or “exclude” –> this determines if the following categories are
      included or excluded in the output file
   4. a list of categories separated by spaces
   5. an optional parameter “-remove-description” which, if entered, removes all
      descriptions from events and alarms

Easy, eh?!
